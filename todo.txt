ok // create separate activity for menu list
ok // create recent food list
ok // save last used weight per food

// better handling of remove: remove multiple items at once
ok // move meal list to SharedPreferences
ok // start calculator intent? to be able to add carbs manually
ok // add my food list 
ok  -> should be separate from MainActivity so we can differentiate between editing a food and adding it to a meal
ok // search recent food list
ok // use index in removeFoodItemFromMeal() because there may be multiple equal foodItems there
ok // confirm with user before clearing recent and meal
ok // change meal total background color -> changed the text instead
ok // protect access to mFilteredList with mutex -> no need after changing BaseAdaptor
ok // add toast msg after removing item
ok // replace food list serialization with simpler save/restore of each FoodItem field
   -> serialization also fails if class name is changed, or if class is moved to a subfolder
// remove recent foods and meal item lists and save to database tables instead
ok // fix bug: after startup, switch to Recent or Meal, then rotate phone, then change language -> crash because mFoodDbAdapter is null
ok // In Food Details, add "x g carbs per y g" under the food name
ok // clear my foods -> are you sure?
ok // ClearableEditableText's delete icon disappears when moving from the Meal tab to any of the other 3 tabs
      -> all tabs now have this search text field, so this problem does not occur anymore.
ok // Test on emulator API v8
ok // when removing a MyFood, also update the recent and meal lists
ok // Android API v8 Alert dialog has different button order: Remove|Cancel
ok // Check for duplicate name when adding new MyFood
ok // clear MyFoods table in production db
ok // add capability to accept plain text data intent -> this should be imported to MyFoods list
// Align buttons in FoodDetailsActivity -> especially with dutch text
ng // translate confirmation and import messages to dutch
   -> just support english
ng // Add search icon to search edit text
ok // change clear icon of clearable edit text
ok // remove "Settings" in menu
ok // add About in menu
