ok // create separate activity for menu list
ok // create recent food list
ok // save last used weight per food

// better handling of remove: remove multiple items at once
ok // move meal list to SharedPreferences
// start calculator intent? to be able to add carbs manually
ok // add my food list 
 -> should be separate from MainActivity so we can differentiate between editing a food and adding it to a meal
ok // search recent food list
ok // use index in removeFoodItemFromMeal() because there may be multiple equal foodItems there
ok // confirm with user before clearing recent and meal
// change meal total background color
ok // protect access to mFilteredList with mutex -> no need after changing BaseAdaptor
// add toast msg after removing item
// replace food list serialization with simpler save/restore of each FoodItem field
// remove recent foods and meal item lists and save to database tables instead
ok // fix bug: after startup, switch to Recent or Meal, then rotate phone, then change language -> crash because mFoodDbAdapter is null
ok // In Food Details, add "x g carbs per y g" under the food name
// clear my foods -> are you sure?
