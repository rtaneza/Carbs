Carbs
=====

Carbs is an Android app that shows carbohydrate information of various foods. 
You can search the default food database or add your own food data.
Food names can be switched between Dutch and English.
I wrote this because I have Type 1 Diabetes and constantly need to count how much carbohydrates I eat.

The food data is taken from NEVO-online version 2013/4.0, RIVM, Bilthoven. This is the [Nederlands Voedingsstoffenbestand (NEVO)](http://www.rivm.nl/Onderwerpen/Onderwerpen/N/Nederlands_Voedingsstoffenbestand), the Dutch Food Composition Database.

The latest version of this app is available at <https://github.com/rtaneza/Carbs>.
