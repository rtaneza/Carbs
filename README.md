Carbs
=====

This is an Android app that shows carbohydrate information of various foods. 
Food names are currently only in Dutch.
I wrote this because I have Type 1 Diabetes and constantly need to count how much carbohydrates I eat.

The food data is taken from the [Nederlands Voedingsstoffenbestand (NEVO)](
http://www.rivm.nl/Onderwerpen/Onderwerpen/N/Nederlands_Voedingsstoffenbestand), which is the Dutch Food Composition Database.

TODO
----

- Add English food names
- Add ability to input food's weight in grams and get the corresponding amount of carbohydrates 
- Add option to input standard portion sizes
- Add option to input own foods
- Add "most recently searched items" list
